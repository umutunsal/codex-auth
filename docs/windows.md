# Windows

## CLI output

Windows console hosts vary in how they handle UTF-8 text and ANSI escape
sequences. `codex-auth` keeps Windows CLI output conservative so PowerShell,
Windows Terminal, `cmd.exe`, and CI logs stay readable.

### Color

- Color is enabled only for TTY output.
- `NO_COLOR` disables color.
- On Windows, ANSI color is emitted only after
  `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING` is already enabled or can be enabled for
  the target console handle.
- If virtual-terminal processing cannot be verified, output falls back to plain
  text with no ANSI escape sequences.

### Characters

- Windows-facing status markers must be ASCII by default.
- Do not use Unicode status glyphs such as check marks, warning signs, bullets,
  arrows, or box-drawing characters in Windows default output.
- Unicode may be used for non-Windows output when it is already part of an
  established command style.
